# WeatherService To get the weather report of the Cities bases on the CITY ID
# we need to upload the excel file which should have 2 columns named as"CityID" & "CityName"
# We can place any number of Cities in the Excel file 
# when user click on upload button from the view , The data table will be displayed with the excel data.
# Also the directory "@"C:\\Temp\WeatherServiceData\\" + Todaysdate" with this path where Todays date will be the present date will be created.
# The data from the Open source weather API will get saved in txt filein XML readable format inside the directory according to the present date.
# To maintain the historical data we have saved the file name as the combination of City Name and the timestamp.
